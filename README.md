# Tripleten web_project_around_react

This project was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Vite, with the design created in Figma. The page was dedicated to showcasing everything learned so far in the course, including the use of Flexbox, Grid, Position, forms, and card creation, always aiming to deliver the most faithful result possible to the original Figma design. The site was built to be responsive across at least three different screen sizes, and JavaScript was integrated with all these elements to add functionality and interactivity, ensuring the React application is fully functional when executed.
